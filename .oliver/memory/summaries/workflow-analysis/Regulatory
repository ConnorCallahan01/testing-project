## Key Points

- The Regulatory Tracker is an AI-powered application that automates detection, analysis, and workflow management of regulatory updates using Claude AI as a mock agentic backend
- User journey spans seven phases: initial dashboard access, scan configuration, backend orchestration, results review, workflow management, knowledge store access, and documentation export
- Backend scan execution follows a 7-stage pipeline: initializing, retrieving mock sources, detecting changes via keyword analysis, AI-powered analysis, confidence scoring, artifact generation, and finalization
- Claude AI performs critical analysis tasks including relevance determination, impact level classification (Low/Medium/High/Critical), and confidence scoring (0.0-1.0), with items flagged for human review if confidence < 0.7
- Workflow management enables progressive status transitions (Draft → In Review → Verified) with human verification required before items enter the knowledge store
- System generates professional compliance documentation in both markdown and Word formats, with verified items searchable and exportable from the knowledge store
